**Goals**:

- Categorize newspapers news within different categories through a machine learning model trained from scratch.
- Analyze trends of the different categories over the years.
- Geolocation tool to see collected metrics on the different cities.

**Vision**: Using historical data from Arquivo.pt this tool could be helpful in providing insights about how subjects like Crime, Environment, and Health are evolving over the years in Portugal's district capitals. This could be used as a proxy for cities life quality.
